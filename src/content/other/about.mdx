I am transitioning from backend development to cybersecurity. My background includes working with Python, JavaScript, Docker, and PostgreSQL, mainly building APIs and internal tools.

I am currently studying for a Technical Degree in Cybersecurity, focusing on networks, vulnerability assessment, and application security. My previous development experience gives me a strong foundation to understand how systems work from the inside and how to protect them.

I am looking to apply what I am learning through labs, projects, and hands-on experiences that will help me grow in the field.
